# Python Caesar Cipher Encoder and Decoder.

## A functional Caesar cipher encoder and decoder that allows you to create cryptic messages that you can send to other people that have a decoder. 

This program is an example that was built along with a Codecademy project called Off-Platform Project: Coded Correspondence. This program allows the user to chose wether they would like to encode a message with a certain number of steps in the english alphabet, or decode a message either using a known amount of steps used in the cryptic message or by brute forcing the cryptic message. This program is a sample code which shows how to use the following:

- Using the ability to create your own function
- Getting the users input for decision making
- The use of Strings and different str.methods to gather information
- Using string indexing
- Using while and for loops
- Using if statements 
- Using f-strings
- Using the Modulus operator


##  How to use this program on your own
I'd encourage you to clone and use this program in whatever IDE you feel comfortable using.
